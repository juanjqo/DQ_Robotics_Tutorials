DQ Robotics Python3 is recommended for most users. Use this version for easy and computationally efficient (**C++ code runs under the hood for fast performance**) implementations.

DQ Robotics C++11 is recommended for **real-time high-performance applications** and if you are not afraid of pointers.
Furthermore, if terms such as C++11, [CMAKE](https://cmake.org/), PPA, and linking are unfamiliar to you, 
consider using the Python3 or MATLAB version of DQ Robotics instead.

DQ Robotics Matlab is adequate if you want to test your ideas fast while having convenient visualization tools, 
provided you have access to the [Mathworks software](https://www.mathworks.com/).
However, if you want high-performance implementations, consider using the Python or C++ version of DQ Robotics.

Assuming that you already have Matlab installed on you computer, 
download the most recent Matlab toolbox of DQ Robotics **[here](https://github.com/dqrobotics/matlab/releases/latest)**.
After downloading the file dqrobotics-YY-MM.mltbx, where YY-MM stands for the year and month of release, just open it and Matlab should copy the files to the folder `Toolboxes/dqrobotics-YY-MM` in your `$HOME` folder and appropriately set the Matlab path.
