[![MATLAB Test](https://github.com/dqrobotics/matlab/actions/workflows/matlab_test.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/dqrobotics/matlab/actions/workflows/matlab_test.yml)



:::tip Release version (recommended for most users)

Assuming that you already have Matlab installed on you computer, 
download the most recent Matlab toolbox of DQ Robotics **[here](https://github.com/dqrobotics/matlab/releases/latest)**.
After downloading the file dqrobotics-YY-MM.mltbx, where YY-MM stands for the year and month of release, just open it and Matlab should copy the files to the folder `Toolboxes/dqrobotics-YY-MM` in your `$HOME` folder and appropriately set the Matlab path.

More details at the **[docs](https://dqroboticsgithubio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/matlab.html#matlab-installation)**.

:::

:::caution Development version

Those wanting the results of our latest developments can checkout the master branch of the **[Matlab repository](https://github.com/dqrobotics/matlab)**.
In order to use DQ Robotics on your MATLAB installation, and supposing you did the checkout at [PATH_TO_DQ_ROBOTICS_FOLDER], just add

```bash
[PATH_TO_DQ_ROBOTICS_FOLDER]/matlab/
```
